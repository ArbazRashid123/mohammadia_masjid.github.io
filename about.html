          The masjid owes its existence to the generosity of local benefactors who donated land for this noble cause. Their selflessness laid the foundation for a place that continues to serve the community.<br><h3>Primary Land Donors:</h3><br>
<strong>1. Gh. Qadir Sheer Gojri (Son of Gh. Mohammad Sheer Gojri)</strong><br>
<strong>2. Abdul Raheem Sheer Gojri (Son of Ab Salam Sheer Gojri)</strong><br>
With time, as the masjid’s influence and responsibilities grew, additional land was acquired, expanding the total area to approximately 19 marlas. This expansion has enabled the masjid to accommodate more worshippers and enhance its educational and social welfare programs.
